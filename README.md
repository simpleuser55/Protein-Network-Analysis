# Protein-Network-Analysis
Built a small project using R to analyze proteinâ€“protein interactions from the BIOGRID database. Extracted protein interactors (using official gene symbols) and identified hub proteins (highly connected nodes). Created a sub-network graph to visualize their interactions. This dataset and graph can help to analyze and visualize sample protein hubs.
